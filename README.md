# Hello, folks! ðŸ‘‹

My name is Kristo Abdi and I'm a student at Sekolah Teknik Elektro dan Informatika, Bandung Institute of Technology. Currently I'm learning some programming languages to tighten my skills. Any support or suggestion will be welcomed. Thanks!

## Blog & Writing

I also maintain and writing on a blog which have some solutions for [TLX problems](https://tlx.toki.id.) but not yet completed. You can find and read some on [here](https://www.medium.com/kristabdi/).
Iâ€™m currently learning C++ and Python. Looking forward to learn any developing skills that can be helpful for my career.
